## Notes for instructor
This version of the Noughts and Crosses will not automatically determine a winner. Instead, this is up to the individual player. The computer will also choose its turn randomly, rather than strategically. I have set an internal threshold of 50 attempts for the computer to randomly find a valid move in order to prevent a continous while loop from occurring.
